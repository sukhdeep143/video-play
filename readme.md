🧠 Learn Python by Building a Video Player 🎬  
A step-by-step roadmap to mastering Python and GUI development by creating your own open-source video player!

---

 📘 1. Python Fundamentals

You should be comfortable with:

- ✅ Variables, data types, conditionals
- 🔁 Loops (`for`, `while`)
- 🧩 Functions and modular code
- 🧠 Classes, objects (`self`, `__init__`)
- 📦 Modules and imports

💡 Mini Projects: Build a calculator, a to-do app, or a number guessing game to get hands-on!

---

 🧱 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Understand how to structure your code better using classes:

- 🏗️ What is a class and an object?
- ⚙️ What does `__init__` do?
- 🔄 What is `self`?
- 📚 How to organize logic using OOP (like our `VideoPlayer` class)

---

 🖼️ 3. Tkinter (GUI Programming)

Build desktop apps with native Python:

- 🪟 Create windows and frames
- 🎛️ Use widgets like `Button`, `Canvas`, `Label`, etc.
- 🖱️ Handle events (e.g., button clicks)
- 🔲 Layout management with `pack()`, `grid()`, and `place()`

 📦 4. Using External Libraries (like VLC)

- 🌍 What are third-party libraries?
- 💾 How to install them using `pip`
- 🔍 How to read docs (e.g. `python-vlc`)
- 🎥 How to connect VLC with Tkinter GUI

🧪 Example:

```bash
pip install python-vlc
```

---

 💻 5. Platform-Specific Coding

Make your app work on all systems:

- 🧠 Use `platform.system()` to detect OS
- 🪟 Linux: `set_xwindow()`  
- 🪟 Windows: `set_hwnd()`  
- 🍏 macOS: `set_nsobject()`

---

 🗂️ 6. Project Structure & Virtual Environments

- 🔒 Why `.venv` is important (isolates your dependencies)
- 📁 Organize your project files neatly
- 📝 Create a `README.md` for documentation
- 📋 Use `requirements.txt` to save your packages:

  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

---

 🌱 Optional (Level-Up Ideas)

- ⏸️ Add pause, stop, and volume controls
- 🖥️ Fullscreen toggle
- 📦 Package as `.deb` (Linux) or `.exe` (Windows)
- ☁️ Push to GitHub (use version control)
